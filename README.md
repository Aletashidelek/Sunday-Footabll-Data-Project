# Sunday-Footabll-Data-Project
Full circle data project for sunday amateur football team

## Overview
- I conduct data collection, storage, visualization, and sharing of player performance data for my amateur footabll team based in Phnom Penh. The whole data process is conducted by myself because I wanted to bring another layer of entertainment and engagement to our team.

## Process
### Data Collection
- I collect player data - scores and assists - for our 6v6 football sessions that happen weekly on sunday. I do this manually by typing in the record of each goal into my phone

### Data Migration and Storage
- I then transfer all these manually typed in records line by line into Excel weekly and then into PostgreSQL monthly. I design a simple relational data model to store individual goal record, game squad, and game result record separately for better analysis.

### Data Visualization
- I conduct data visualization in Tableau monthly using the records from Excel

### Data Sharing
- Lastly, I share the dashboard into the group chat and our social media administrator to have it posted on our social account.
